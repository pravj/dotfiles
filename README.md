> Because things are really cool in this world.

```ruby
$ dotfiles/vim
```
```ruby
.
|__.vim
| |__bundle
| |__ftplugin
| | |__python
| | | |__pep8.vim
| | |__ruby
| | | |__ruby_style.vim
| |__colors
| |__autoload
| | |__pathogen.vim
| |__ftdetect
| | |__custom_filetypes.vim

```

> some of the things that are inside :

* manage your work according to `Python's pep8` and `Ruby's global style guide`.
* mappings to quickly comment single or multiple lines according to programming languages
* general mappings required to make your editing cool.

```ruby
$ dotfiles/ruby
```

```ruby
.
|__.gemrc
|__.irbrc
```
* global gemfile configurations
* customized IRB console

```ruby
$ dotfiles/git
```

```ruby
.
|__.gitconfig
```
* global git configurations with UI layout and useful aliases.

```ruby
$ dotfiles/bash
```

```
.
|__.bashrc
```

* useful `bash` aliases and configurations

### walk slowly : work in progress :


* I want to try a `bash_prompt` or `shell : status-line` like thing
> there are many similar in market but It's a cool feeling in using your own thing

* So I have put a `.md` file in a chemical solution and now waiting to see it changed in `.sh` or something.
